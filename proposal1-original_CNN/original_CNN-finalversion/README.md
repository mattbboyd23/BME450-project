The CNN architecture lives in llr_cnn_model.py. The eval_llr_model.py file can be ran to evaluate 15 specified test samples from the dataset using the optimized model parameters. The LLRDataset class is defined in llr_dataset.py , which reads the Excel file that was compiled from MATLAB scripts and contains the ground truth labels for every sample. The training script is stored in train_llr_model.py.
