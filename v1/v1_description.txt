Our v1 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to predict six anatomical landmark coordinates from long-leg radiograph (LLR) images. The network takes a single-channel grayscale input resized to 896×256 and passes it through four sequential convolutional layers, each using 5×5 kernels with padding to preserve spatial resolution. After each convolution, a ReLU activation adds non-linearity, and a 2×2 max-pooling layer reduces the feature map size by half, helping the model gradually build a larger receptive field. These stacked layers allow the model to extract low-to-high level features, starting from basic edges and progressing toward complex bone structures. After the last convolutional block, the feature map is flattened and passed through two fully connected layers that compress the learned features and output 12 values — corresponding to the (x, y) pixel coordinates of the six key anatomical landmarks (hip, knee, and ankle on both legs). The model is optimized using mean squared error (MSE) loss between the predicted and ground truth coordinates.
